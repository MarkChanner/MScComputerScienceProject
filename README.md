# MSc Computer Science Final Project

This is the fourth, and most recent, prototype of a tile matching game that I made for my MSc Computer Science final project. It is designed to help children with autism to recognize people's facial expressions.

The game is in the popular genre of the matching-tile game. The idea is to make a connection of 3 or more emoticons of the same type by swapping adjacent pairs on the board. When a match is made, the matching emoticons are removed and those above drop down accordingly, then new randomly generated emoticons fill the vacant spaces on the board.

It is hoped that by playing the game and focusing on the different expressions, and hearing the emotion names when a match is made, that children will be able to practice recognizing and differentiating between facial expressions and the emotions they represent. To aid this, each emotion is emphasized through a combination of graphics, sounds, and points.

The Android version of this game has not yet been uploaded to the Play store, but a JavaScript prototype can be accessed [here](https://github.com/MarkChanner/MScProjectPrototype-JavaScript01) if you would like to play the game.
