# MScComputerScienceFinalProject

Introduction

This is the fourth prototype of a tile matching game that I wil be working on until September 2016 for my MSc Computer Science final project. It is designed to help children with autism to recognize people's facial expressions.

The game is in the popular genre of the matching-tile game. The idea is to make a connection of 3 or more emoticons of the same type by swapping adjacent pairs on the board. When a match is made, the matching emoticons are removed and those above drop down accordingly, then new randomly generated emoticons fill the vacant spaces on the board

It is hoped that by playing the game and focusing on the different expressions, and hearing that emotion names when a match is made, that children will be able to practice recognizing and differentiating between the emoticons. To aid this, each emotion is emphasized through a combination of graphics, sounds, and points.
